# Stock Market Price Forecasting using LSTM

This project is an end-to-end **Stock Price Forecasting Web Application** built using **Python, TensorFlow (LSTM), and Streamlit**. It predicts future stock prices based on historical data using deep learning techniques and provides an interactive web interface for training and visualization.

---

## Features
- Upload historical stock price CSV files
- Train an LSTM-based deep learning model
- Visualize stock price trends
- Forecast future stock prices (next 30 days)
- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit UI
- Modular and well-structured Python code

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Utilities:** Scikit-learn

## Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-forecasting.git
- cd stock-price-forecasting
### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment
- python -m venv .venv
- .\.venv\Scripts\activate
### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Or install manually:
- pip install streamlit tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance
###▶️ How to Run the Project
- streamlit run app_streamlit.py
- Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8501

## How It Works
- User uploads historical stock price data
- Data is normalized and converted into time-series sequences
- LSTM model is trained using past stock prices
- Model predicts future stock price trends
- Results are visualized using interactive charts

## Disclaimer
- This project is created for educational purposes only.
- Stock market predictions are probabilistic and should not be used for real-world trading decisions.
